        Abstract base class to be inherited by raw data classes

        Authors: Ed Smith and David Trevelyan (October 2014) 

        The RawData class is an abstract base class which defines the interface
        that all rawdata readers must provide. The raw data class is 
        associated with both a data file (e.g. mbins, pVA, etc.) and a
        results directory in which the simulation_header is located. 
        This header contains necessary 
        information that is used to reshape the 1D array of data read 
        from the file into a format that is easy to process later on.
           
        The header variable cpol_bins is true if the data has been
        averaged in the MD code using cylindrical polar bins: in this 
        case the only difference lies in creating the mesh of the 
        bin topology, because the domain size in cylindrical polar
        coordinates is different to the cartesian domain size that is
        written to the simulation_header.

        This class is designed for use in two ways:
            
            1) As a contained object within another that packages
               and returns the data in a 3D field format (from which 
               it may be averaged/summed/sliced into a new format that 
               you may want to plot), i.e. an MDField object, or

            2) For inspection of the numerical values in any binary
               data file in a results folder from the MD code.
