This directory contains potential files for different elements and
alloys, as used by LAMMPS for various pair styles.  See the
description of the "pair_style" and "pair_coeff" commands for details
of the file formats and the various styles in LAMMPS that read these
files.

The prefix of each file indicates the element(s) it is parameterized
for.  An additional lower-case identification tag may be appended.

Si = Silicon
SiC = Silicon and Carbon
Au_u3 = Gold universal 3

For many of the files, comments in the header section give origin and
citation information. Note that these files are provided primarily to 
demonstrate the different types of interatomic potentials that LAMMPS 
supports. In most cases we have confirmed that when used with the
latest LAMMPS code, it reproduces results in the cited publication.
In some cases, it may be necessary to specify other parameters not 
contained in the potential file. Also, for particular
materials and applications, a different potential file may be more 
suitable than the one provided here. For best results, users should 
do a thorough search of published literature and on-line databases
such as Knowledgebase of Interatomic Models (KIM) and Interatomic 
Potentials Repository Project (NIST).
They should then choose the best potential for their 
application, and verify that they have defined it correctly in LAMMPS 
by comparing with published results for that potential.
