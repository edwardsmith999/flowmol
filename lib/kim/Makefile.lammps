# This file contains the hooks to build and link LAMMPS with the OpenKIM
# library so that a LAMMPS input script can use a KIM potential, via the
# pair_style kim command.
# 
# You should first download KIM from www.openkim.org.  Then build its
# library API in KIM_API, with the models (potentials) you want to use.
# You should then have the files:
# 
# openkim-api-vX.X.X/KIM_API/libkim.a
# openkim-api-vX.X.X/KIM_API/libkim.so
# 
# When you build LAMMPS with the KIM package installed, it will use the
# 3 settings in this file.  They should be set as follows.
# 
# kim_SYSINC = a path to the KIM_API directory that contains *.h files
# kim_SYSLIB = compiler flag to use the KIM library
# kim_SYSPATH = a path to the KIM library

# -----------------------------------------------------------

# Settings that the LAMMPS build will import when this package is installed

kim_SYSINC  = $(shell kim-api-build-config --includes)
kim_SYSLIB  = $(shell kim-api-build-config --ldlibs)
kim_SYSPATH = $(shell kim-api-build-config --ldflags)
