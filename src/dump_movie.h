/* ERROR/WARNING messages:

E: Invalid dump movie filename

The file produced by dump movie cannot be binary or compressed
and must be a single file for a single processor.

E: Support for writing movies not included

UNDOCUMENTED

E: Failed to open FFmpeg pipeline to file %s

The specified file cannot be opened.  Check that the path and name are
correct and writable and that the FFmpeg executable can be found and run.

E: Illegal ... command

Self-explanatory.  Check the input script syntax and compare to the
documentation for the command.  You can use -echo screen as a
command-line option when running LAMMPS to see the offending line.

U: Cannot generate movie file

LAMMPS was built without the -DLAMMPS_FFMPEG switch in the Makefile

U: pipe:: Input/output error

Harmless. This happens when the pipeline to FFmpeg is closed and no
more image data is sent to be appended to the movie. FFmpeg will 
simply terminate and close the movie file.
