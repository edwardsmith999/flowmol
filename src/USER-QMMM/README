This package implements the "fix qmmm" command which can be used
in a LAMMPS input script.

This fix enables LAMMPS to be used in a QM/MM simulation, currently
only in combination with pw.x code from the Quantum ESPRESSO package.

The person who created this package is Axel Kohlmeyer at Temple U
(akohlmey at gmail.com).  Contact him directly if you have questions.
