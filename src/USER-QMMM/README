This package implements the "fix qmmm" command which can be used
in a LAMMPS input script.

This fix allows to do QM/MM simulations, currently only in
combination with pw.x code from the Quantum ESPRESSO package. 

The person who created this package is Axel Kohlmeyer at Temple U
(akohlmey at gmail.com).  Contact him directly if you have questions.
