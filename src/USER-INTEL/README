-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This package is based on the USER-OMP package and provides LAMMPS styles that:

   1. include support for single and mixed precision in addition to double.
   2. include modifications to support vectorization for key routines
   3. include modifications to support offload to Xeon Phi coprocessors

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

When using the suffix command with "intel", intel styles will be used if they
exist; if they do not, and an omp version exists, that style will be used.
This is accomplished through the files *ompinto_intel.h that are created
in the src directory when the intel package is installed. For example,

      kspace_style     pppm/intel 1e-4

is equivalent to:

      kspace_style     pppm/omp   1e-4

because no pppm style has been implemented for the Intel package.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to use offload to Xeon Phi, the flag -DLMP_INTEL_OFFLOAD should be
set in the Makefile. Offload requires the use of Intel compilers.
