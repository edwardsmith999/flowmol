/* ERROR/WARNING messages:

E: Illegal ... command

Self-explanatory.  Check the input script syntax and compare to the
documentation for the command.  You can use -echo screen as a
command-line option when running LAMMPS to see the offending line.

E: Fix pour requires atom attributes radius, rmass

The atom style defined does not have these attributes.

E: Fix pour region ID does not exist

Self-explanatory.

E: Must specify a region in fix pour

The region keyword must be specified with this fix.

E: Fix pour region does not support a bounding box

Not all regions represent bounded volumes.  You cannot use
such a region with the fix pour command.

E: Fix pour region cannot be dynamic

Only static regions can be used with fix pour.

E: Insertion region extends outside simulation box

Region specified with fix pour command extends outside the global
simulation box.

E: Must use a z-axis cylinder with fix pour

The axis of the cylinder region used with the fix pour command must
be oriented along the z dimension.

E: Must use a block or cylinder region with fix pour

Self-explanatory.

E: Must use a block region with fix pour for 2d simulations

Self-explanatory.

E: No fix gravity defined for fix pour

Cannot add poured particles without gravity to move them.

E: Cannot use fix pour with triclinic box

This feature is not yet supported.

E: Gravity must point in -z to use with fix pour in 3d

Gravity must be pointing "down" in a 3d box, i.e. theta = 180.0.

E: Gravity must point in -y to use with fix pour in 2d

Gravity must be pointing "down" in a 2d box.

E: Gravity changed since fix pour was created

Gravity must be static and not dynamic for use with fix pour.

W: Less insertions than requested

Less atom insertions occurred on this timestep due to the fix pour
command than were scheduled.  This is probably because there were too
many overlaps detected.

E: Cannot change timestep with fix pour

This fix pre-computes some values based on the timestep, so it cannot
be changed during a simulation run.
