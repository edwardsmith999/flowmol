<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Define a computation that calculates the translational kinetic energy
of a group of particles.
</P>
<P>The kinetic energy of each particle is computed as 1/2 m v^2, where m
and v are the mass and velocity of the particle.
</P>
<P>There is a subtle difference between the quantity calculated by this
compute and the kinetic energy calculated by the <I>ke</I> or <I>etotal</I>
keyword used in thermodynamic output, as specified by the
<A HREF = "thermo_style.html">thermo_style</A> command.  For this compute, kinetic
energy is "translational" kinetic energy, calculated by the simple
formula above.  For thermodynamic output, the <I>ke</I> keyword infers
kinetic energy from the temperature of the system with 1/2 Kb T of
energy for each degree of freedom.  For the default temperature
computation via the <A HREF = "compute_temp.html">compute temp</A> command, these
are the same.  But different computes that calculate temperature can
subtract out different non-thermal components of velocity and/or
include different degrees of freedom (translational, rotational, etc).
</P>
<P><B>Output info:</B>
</P>
<P>This compute calculates a global scalar (the summed KE).  This value
can be used by any command that uses a global scalar value from a
compute as input.  See <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_15">Section_howto 15</A>
for an overview of LAMMPS output options.
</P>
<P>The scalar value calculated by this compute is "extensive".  The
scalar value will be in energy <A HREF = "units.html">units</A>.
