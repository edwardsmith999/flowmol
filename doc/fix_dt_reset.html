<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Reset the timestep size every N steps during a run, so that no atom
moves further than Xmax, based on current atom velocities and forces.
This can be useful when starting from a configuration with overlapping
atoms, where forces will be large.  Or it can be useful when running
an impact simulation where one or more high-energy atoms collide with
a solid, causing a damage cascade.
</P>
<P>This fix overrides the timestep size setting made by the
<A HREF = "timestep.html">timestep</A> command.  The new timestep size <I>dt</I> is
computed in the following manner.
</P>
<P>For each atom, the timestep is computed that would cause it to
displace <I>Xmax</I> on the next integration step, as a function of its
current velocity and force.  Since performing this calculation exactly
would require the solution to a quartic equation, a cheaper estimate
is generated.  The estimate is conservative in that the atom's
displacement is guaranteed not to exceed <I>Xmax</I>, though it may be
smaller.
</P>
<P>Given this putative timestep for each atom, the minimum timestep value
across all atoms is computed.  Then the <I>Tmin</I> and <I>Tmax</I> bounds are
applied, if specified.  If one (or both) is specified as NULL, it is
not applied.
</P>
<P>When the <A HREF = "run_style.html">run style</A> is <I>respa</I>, this fix resets the
outer loop (largest) timestep, which is the same timestep that the
<A HREF = "timestep.html">timestep</A> command sets.
</P>
<P>Note that the cumulative simulation time (in time units), which
accounts for changes in the timestep size as a simulation proceeds,
can be accessed by the <A HREF = "thermo_style.html">thermo_style time</A> keyword.
</P>
<P><B>Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:</B>
</P>
<P>No information about this fix is written to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
files</A>.  None of the <A HREF = "fix_modify.html">fix_modify</A> options
are relevant to this fix.
</P>
<P>This fix computes a global scalar which can be accessed by various
<A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_15">output commands</A>.  The scalar stores
the last timestep on which the timestep was reset to a new value.
</P>
<P>The scalar value calculated by this fix is "intensive".
</P>
<P>No parameter of this fix can be used with the <I>start/stop</I> keywords of
the <A HREF = "run.html">run</A> command.  This fix is not invoked during <A HREF = "minimize.html">energy
minimization</A>.
