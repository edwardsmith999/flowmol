<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Using a pair style of none means pair forces are not computed.
</P>
<P>With this choice, the force cutoff is 0.0, which means that only atoms
within the neighbor skin distance (see the <A HREF = "neighbor.html">neighbor</A>
command) are communicated between processors.  You must insure the
skin distance is large enough to acquire atoms needed for computing
bonds, angles, etc.
</P>
<P>A pair style of <I>none</I> will also prevent pairwise neighbor lists from
being built.  However if the <A HREF = "neighbor.html">neighbor</A> style is <I>bin</I>,
data structures for binning are still allocated.  If the neighbor skin
distance is small, then these data structures can consume a large
amount of memory.  So you should either set the neighbor style to
<I>nsq</I> or set the skin distance to a larger value.
