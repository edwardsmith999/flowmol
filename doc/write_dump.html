<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Dump a single snapshot of atom quantities to one or more files for the
current state of the system.  This is a one-time immediate operation,
in contrast to the <A HREF = "dump.html">dump</A> command which will will set up a
dump style to write out snapshots periodically during a running
simulation.
</P>
<P>The syntax for this command is mostly identical to that of the
<A HREF = "dump.html">dump</A> and <A HREF = "dump_modify.html">dump_modify</A> commands as if
they were concatenated together, with the following exceptions: There
is no need for a dump ID or dump frequency and the keyword <I>modify</I> is
added.  The latter is so that the full range of
<A HREF = "dump_modify.html">dump_modify</A> options can be specified for the single
snapshot, just as they can be for multiple snapshots.  The <I>modify</I>
keyword separates the arguments that would normally be passed to the
<I>dump</I> command from those that would be given the <I>dump_modify</I>.  Both
support optional arguments and thus LAMMPS needs to be able to cleanly
separate the two sets of args.
</P>
<P>Note that if the specified filename uses the wildcard characters
"*" or "%", as supported by the <A HREF = "dump.html">dump</A> commmand, they will
operate in the same fashion to create the new filename(s).
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>All restrictions for the <A HREF = "dump.html">dump</A> and
<A HREF = "dump_modify.html">dump_modify</A> commands apply to this command as well.
For the <A HREF = "dump_image.html">dump image</A> dump style, this means the
filename is required to contain a '*' character, which will be
replaced by the current timestep.
</P>
<P>Since dumps are normally written during a <A HREF = "run.html">run</A> or <A HREF = "minimize.html">energy
minimization</A>, the simulation has to be ready to run
before this command can be used.  Similarly, if the dump requires
information from a compute, fix, or variable, the information needs to
have been calculated for the current timestep (e.g. by a prior run),
else LAMMPS will generate an error message.
</P>
<P>For example, it is not possible to dump per-atom energy with this
command before a run has been performed, since no energies and forces
have yet been calculated.  See the <A HREF = "variable.html">variable</A> doc page
sectinn on Variable Accuracy for more information on this topic.
