<PRE>compute ID group-ID temp/region/eff region-ID 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>ID, group-ID are documented in <A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A> command
<LI>temp/region/eff = style name of this compute command
<LI>region-ID = ID of region to use for choosing atoms 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>

</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Define a computation that calculates the temperature of a group of
nuclei and electrons in the <A HREF = "pair_eff.html">electron force field</A>
model, within a geometric region using the electron force field.  A
compute of this style can be used by commands that compute a
temperature, e.g. <A HREF = "thermo_modify.html">thermo_modify</A>.
</P>
<P>The operation of this compute is exactly like that described by the
<A HREF = "compute_temp_region.html">compute temp/region</A> command, except that
the formula for the temperature itself includes the radial electron
velocity contributions, as discussed by the <A HREF = "compute_temp_eff.html">compute
temp/eff</A> command.
</P>
<P><B>Output info:</B>
</P>
<P>This compute calculates a global scalar (the temperature) and a global
vector of length 6 (KE tensor), which can be accessed by indices 1-6.
These values can be used by any command that uses global scalar or
vector values from a compute as input.  See <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_15">this
section</A> for an overview of LAMMPS output
options.
</P>
<P>The scalar value calculated by this compute is "intensive".  The
vector values are "extensive".
</P>
<P>The scalar value will be in temperature <A HREF = "units.html">units</A>.  The
vector values will be in energy <A HREF = "units.html">units</A>.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This compute is part of the USER-EFF package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_3">Making
LAMMPS</A> section for more info.
