<P>Zero out the force and torque on a granular particle.  This is useful
for preventing certain particles from moving in a simulation.  The
<A HREF = "pair_gran.html">granular pair styles</A> also detect if this fix has been
defined and compute interactions between frozen and non-frozen
particles appropriately, as if the frozen particle has infinite mass.
A similar functionality for normal (point) particles can be obtained
using <A HREF = "fix_setforce.html">fix setforce</A>.
</P>
<HR>

<P>Styles with a <I>cuda</I> suffix are functionally the same as the
corresponding style without the suffix.  They have been optimized to
run faster, depending on your available hardware, as discussed in
<A HREF = "Section_accelerate.html">Section_accelerate</A> of the manual.  The
accelerated styles take the same arguments and should produce the same
results, except for round-off and precision issues.
</P>
<P>These accelerated styles are part of the USER-CUDA package.  They are
only enabled if LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_3">Making
LAMMPS</A> section for more info.
</P>
<P>You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_7">-suffix command-line
switch</A> when you invoke LAMMPS, or you can
use the <A HREF = "suffix.html">suffix</A> command in your input script.
</P>
<P>See <A HREF = "Section_accelerate.html">Section_accelerate</A> of the manual for
more instructions on how to use the accelerated styles effectively.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:</B>
</P>
<P>No information about this fix is written to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
files</A>.  None of the <A HREF = "fix_modify.html">fix_modify</A> options
are relevant to this fix.
</P>
<P>This fix computes a global 3-vector of forces, which can be accessed
by various <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_15">output commands</A>.  This is the
total force on the group of atoms before the forces on individual
atoms are changed by the fix.  The vector values calculated by this
fix are "extensive".
</P>
<P>No parameter of this fix can be used with the <I>start/stop</I> keywords of
the <A HREF = "run.html">run</A> command.  This fix is not invoked during <A HREF = "minimize.html">energy
minimization</A>.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This fix is part of the GRANULAR package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_3">Making
LAMMPS</A> section for more info.
</P>
<P>There can only be a single freeze fix defined.  This is because other
the <A HREF = "pair_gran.html">granular pair styles</A> treat frozen particles
differently and need to be able to reference a single group to which
this fix is applied.
