<H3>comm_style command

</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This command sets the style of inter-processor communication of atom
information that occurs each timestep as coordinates and other
properties are exchanged between neighboring processors and stored as
properties of ghost atoms.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: The <I>tiled</I> style is not yet implemented.
</P>
<P>For the default <I>brick</I> style, the domain decomposition used by LAMMPS
to partition the simulation box must be a regular 3d grid of bricks,
one per processor.  Each processor communicates with its 6 Cartesian
neighbors in the grid to acquire information for nearby atoms.
</P>
<P>For the <I>tiled</I> style, a more general domain decomposition can be
used, as triggered by the <A HREF = "balance.html">balance</A> or <A HREF = "fix_balance.html">fix
balance</A> commands.  The simulation box can be
partitioned into non-overlapping rectangular-shaped "tiles" or varying
sizes and shapes.  Again there is one tile per processor.  To acquire
information for nearby atoms, communication must now be done with a
more complex pattern of neighboring processors.
</P>
<P>Note that this command does not actually define a partitoining of the
simulation box (a domain decomposition), rather it determines what
kinds of decompositions are allowed and the pattern of communication
used to enable the decomposition.  A decomposition is created when the
simulation box is first created, via the <A HREF = "create_box.html">create_box</A>
or <A HREF = "read_data.html">read_data</A> or <A HREF = "read_restart.html">read_restart</A>
commands.  For both the <I>brick</I> and <I>tiled</I> styles, the initial
decomposition will be the same, as described by
<A HREF = "create_box.html">create_box</A> and <A HREF = "processors.html">processors</A>
commands.  The decomposition can be changed via the
<A HREF = "balance.html">balance</A> or <A HREF = "fix_balance.html">fix_balance</A> commands.
