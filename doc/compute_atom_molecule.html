<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Define a calculation that sums per-atom values on a per-molecule
basis, one per listed input.  The inputs can <A HREF = "compute.html">computes</A>,
<A HREF = "fix.html">fixes</A>, or <A HREF = "variable.html">variables</A> that generate per-atom
quantities.  Note that attributes stored by atoms, such as mass or
force, can also be summed on a per-molecule basis, by accessing these
quantities via the <A HREF = "compute_property_atom.html">compute property/atom</A>
command.
</P>
<P>Each listed input is operated on independently.  Only atoms within the
specified group contribute to the per-molecule sum.  Note that compute
or fix inputs define their own group which may affect the quantities
they return.  For example, if a compute is used as an input which
generates a per-atom vector, it will generate values of 0.0 for atoms
that are not in the group specified for that compute.
</P>
<P>The ordering of per-molecule quantities produced by this compute is
consistent with the ordering produced by other compute commands that
generate per-molecule datums.  Conceptually, the molecule IDs will be
in ascending order for any molecule with one or more of its atoms in
the specified group.
</P>
<P>If an input begins with "c_", a compute ID must follow which has been
previously defined in the input script and which generates per-atom
quantities.  See the individual <A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A> doc page for
details.  If no bracketed integer is appended, the vector calculated
by the compute is used.  If a bracketed integer is appended, the Ith
column of the array calculated by the compute is used.  Users can also
write code for their own compute styles and <A HREF = "Section_modify.html">add them to
LAMMPS</A>.
</P>
<P>If an input begins with "f_", a fix ID must follow which has been
previously defined in the input script and which generates per-atom
quantities.  See the individual <A HREF = "fix.html">fix</A> doc page for details.
Note that some fixes only produce their values on certain timesteps,
which must be compatible with when compute atom/molecule references
the values, else an error results.  If no bracketed integer is
appended, the vector calculated by the fix is used.  If a bracketed
integer is appended, the Ith column of the array calculated by the fix
is used.  Users can also write code for their own fix style and <A HREF = "Section_modify.html">add
them to LAMMPS</A>.
</P>
<P>If an input begins with "v_", a variable name must follow which has
been previously defined in the input script.  It must be an
<A HREF = "variable.html">atom-style variable</A>.  Atom-style variables can
reference thermodynamic keywords and various per-atom attributes, or
invoke other computes, fixes, or variables when they are evaluated, so
this is a very general means of generating per-atom quantities to sum
on a per-molecule basis.
</P>
<P>Here is an example of using this command to sum up the components of
total force on each molecule and print them to a file every 1000
timesteps.  The printed values could also be time-averaged by the fix
ave/time command if desired, by changing "1000 1 1000" to "10 100
1000" (for example):
</P>
<PRE>compute 1 all property/atom fx fy fz
compute 2 all atom/molecule c_1[1] c_1[2] c_1[3]
fix 1 all ave/time 1000 1 1000 c_2 mode vector file tmp.molecule.force

<P><B>Output info:</B>
</P>
<P>This compute calculates a global vector or global array depending on
the number of input values.  The length of the vector or number of
rows in the array is the number of molecules.  If a single input is
specified, a global vector is produced.  If two or more inputs are
specified, a global array is produced where the number of columns =
the number of inputs.  The vector or array can be accessed by any
command that uses global values from a compute as input.  See <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_15">this
section</A> for an overview of LAMMPS output
options.
</P>
<P>All the vector or array values calculated by this compute are
"extensive".
</P>
<P>The vector or array values will be in whatever <A HREF = "units.html">units</A> the
input quantities are in.
