<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>The <I>umbrella</I> improper style uses the following potential, which is
commonly referred to as a classic inversion and used in the
<A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_4">DREIDING</A> force field:
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "Eqs/improper_umbrella.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P>where K is the force constant and omega is the angle between the IL
axis and the IJK plane:
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "Eqs/umbrella.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P>If omega0 = 0 the potential term has a minimum for the planar
structure.  Otherwise it has two minima at +/- omega0, with a barrier
in between.
</P>
<P>See <A HREF = "#Mayo">(Mayo)</A> for a description of the DREIDING force field.
</P>
<P>The following coefficients must be defined for each improper type via
the <A HREF = "improper_coeff.html">improper_coeff</A> command as in the example
above, or in the data file or restart files read by the
<A HREF = "read_data.html">read_data</A> or <A HREF = "read_restart.html">read_restart</A>
commands:

<P>Styles with a <I>cuda</I>, <I>gpu</I>, <I>intel</I>, <I>kk</I>, <I>omp</I>, or <I>opt</I> suffix are
functionally the same as the corresponding style without the suffix.
They have been optimized to run faster, depending on your available
hardware, as discussed in <A HREF = "Section_accelerate.html">Section_accelerate</A>
of the manual.  The accelerated styles take the same arguments and
should produce the same results, except for round-off and precision
issues.
</P>
<P>These accelerated styles are part of the USER-CUDA, GPU, USER-INTEL,
KOKKOS, USER-OMP and OPT packages, respectively.  They are only
enabled if LAMMPS was built with those packages.  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_3">Making
LAMMPS</A> section for more info.
</P>
<P>You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_7">-suffix command-line
switch</A> when you invoke LAMMPS, or you can
use the <A HREF = "suffix.html">suffix</A> command in your input script.
</P>
<P>See <A HREF = "Section_accelerate.html">Section_accelerate</A> of the manual for
more instructions on how to use the accelerated styles effectively.
</P>

<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This improper style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
MOLECULAR package (which it is by default).  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_3">Making
LAMMPS</A> section for more info on packages.
