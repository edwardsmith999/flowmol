<H3>fix lb/viscous command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>fix ID group-ID lb/viscous 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>ID, group-ID are documented in <A HREF = "fix.html">fix</A> command 

<PRE>lb/viscous = style name of this fix command 
</PRE>

</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<P>fix 1 flow lb/viscous 
</P>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This fix is similar to the <A HREF = "fix_viscous.html">fix viscous</A> command, and
is to be used in place of that command when a lattice-Boltzmann fluid
is present, and the user wishes to integrate the particle motion using
one of the built in LAMMPS integrators.
</P>
<P>This fix adds a force, F = - Gamma*(velocity-fluid_velocity), to each 
atom, where Gamma is the force coupling constant described in the
<A HREF = "fix_lb_fluid.html">fix lb/fluid</A> command (which applies an equal and opposite
force to the fluid).  
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: This fix should only be used in conjunction with one of the
built in LAMMPS integrators; it should not be used with the 
<A HREF = "fix_lb_pc.html">fix lb/pc</A> or <A HREF = "fix_lb_rigid_pc_sphere.html">fix lb/rigid/pc/sphere</A> integrators,  
which already include the hydrodynamic forces.  These latter fixes should only be used if the force coupling constant has been set by the user (instead of using the default value); if the default force coupling value is used, then this fix provides the only method for adding the hydrodynamic forces to the particles.

<P>For further details, as well as descriptions and results of several test runs,
see <A HREF = "#Mackay">Mackay et al.</A> &#91;1&#93; .  Please include a citation to this
paper if this fix is used in work contributing to published research.

<P><B>Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:</B>
</P>
<P>As described in the <A HREF = "fix_viscous.html">fix viscous</A> documentation:
</P>
<P>"No information about this fix is written to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
files</A>.  None of the <A HREF = "fix_modify.html">fix_modify</A> options
are relevant to this fix.  No global or per-atom quantities are stored
by this fix for access by various <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_15">output
commands</A>.  No parameter of this fix can
be used with the <I>start/stop</I> keywords of the <A HREF = "run.html">run</A> command.
</P>
<P>The forces due to this fix are imposed during an energy minimization,
invoked by the <A HREF = "minimize.html">minimize</A> command.  This fix should only
be used with damped dynamics minimizers that allow for
non-conservative forces.  See the <A HREF = "min_style.html">min_style</A> command
for details."
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>Can only be used if a lattice-Boltzmann fluid has been created via the
<A HREF = "fix_lb_fluid.html">fix lb/fluid</A> command, and must come after this command. 
</P>
<P>This fix should not be used if either the <A HREF = "fix_lb_pc.html">fix lb/pc</A> or 
<A HREF = "fix_lb_rigid_pc_sphere.html">fix lb/rigid/pc/sphere</A> integrator is used. 
</P>
<P> This fix can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
"fluid" package.  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#2_3">Making
LAMMPS</A> section for more info on packages.
