<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Apply a spring force to a group of atoms or between two groups of
atoms.  This is useful for applying an umbrella force to a small
molecule or lightly tethering a large group of atoms (e.g. all the
solvent or a large molecule) to the center of the simulation box so
that it doesn't wander away over the course of a long simulation.  It
can also be used to hold the centers of mass of two groups of atoms at
a given distance or orientation with respect to each other.
</P>
<P>The <I>tether</I> style attaches a spring between a fixed point <I>x,y,z</I> and
the center of mass of the fix group of atoms.  The equilibrium
position of the spring is R0.  At each timestep the distance R from
the center of mass of the group of atoms to the tethering point is
computed, taking account of wrap-around in a periodic simulation box.
A restoring force of magnitude K (R - R0) Mi / M is applied to each
atom in the group where <I>K</I> is the spring constant, Mi is the mass of
the atom, and M is the total mass of all atoms in the group.  Note
that <I>K</I> thus represents the total force on the group of atoms, not a
per-atom force.
</P>
<P>The <I>couple</I> style links two groups of atoms together.  The first
group is the fix group; the second is specified by group-ID2.  The
groups are coupled together by a spring that is at equilibrium when
the two groups are displaced by a vector <I>x,y,z</I> with respect to each
other and at a distance R0 from that displacement.  Note that <I>x,y,z</I>
is the equilibrium displacement of group-ID2 relative to the fix
group.  Thus (1,1,0) is a different spring than (-1,-1,0).  When the
relative positions and distance between the two groups are not in
equilibrium, the same spring force described above is applied to atoms
in each of the two groups.
</P>
<P>For both the <I>tether</I> and <I>couple</I> styles, any of the x,y,z values can
be specified as NULL which means do not include that dimension in the
distance calculation or force application.
</P>
<P>The first example above pulls the ligand towards the point (0,0,0).
The second example holds the ligand near the surface of a sphere of
radius 5 around the point (0,0,0).  The third example holds the ligand
a distance 3 away from the z=2 plane (on either side).
</P>
<P>The fourth example holds 2 bilayers a distance 10 apart in z.  For the
last two examples, imagine a pore (a slab of atoms with a cylindrical
hole cut out) oriented with the pore axis along z, and an ion moving
within the pore.  The fifth example holds the ion a distance of -20
below the z = 0 center plane of the pore (umbrella sampling).  The
last example holds the ion a distance 5 away from the pore axis
(assuming the center-of-mass of the pore in x,y is the pore axis).
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: The center of mass of a group of atoms is calculated
in "unwrapped" coordinates using atom image flags, which means that
the group can straddle a periodic boundary.  See the <A HREF = "dump.html">dump</A>
doc page for a discussion of unwrapped coordinates.  It also means
that a spring connecting two groups or a group and the tether point
can cross a periodic boundary and its length be calculated correctly.
One exception is for rigid bodies, which should not be used with the
fix spring command, if the rigid body will cross a periodic boundary.
This is because image flags for rigid bodies are used in a different
way, as explained on the <A HREF = "fix_rigid.html">fix rigid</A> doc page.

<P><B>Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:</B>
</P>
<P>No information about this fix is written to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
files</A>. 
</P>
<P>The <A HREF = "fix_modify.html">fix_modify</A> <I>energy</I> option is supported by this
fix to add the energy stored in the spring to the system's potential
energy as part of <A HREF = "thermo_style.html">thermodynamic output</A>.
</P>
<P>This fix computes a global scalar which can be accessed by various
<A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_15">output commands</A>.  The scalar is the
spring energy = 0.5 * K * r^2.
</P>
<P>This fix also computes global 4-vector which can be accessed by
various <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_15">output commands</A>.  The first 3
quantities in the vector are xyz components of the total force added
to the group of atoms by the spring.  In the case of the <I>couple</I>
style, it is the force on the fix group (group-ID) or the negative of
the force on the 2nd group (group-ID2).  The 4th quantity in the
vector is the magnitude of the force added by the spring, as a
positive value if (r-R0) > 0 and a negative value if (r-R0) < 0.  This
sign convention can be useful when using the spring force to compute a
potential of mean force (PMF).
</P>
<P>The scalar and vector values calculated by this fix are "extensive".
</P>
<P>No parameter of this fix can be used with the <I>start/stop</I> keywords of
the <A HREF = "run.html">run</A> command.
</P>
<P>The forces due to this fix are imposed during an energy minimization,
invoked by the <A HREF = "minimize.html">minimize</A> command.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: If you want the spring energy to be included in the
total potential energy of the system (the quantity being minimized),
you MUST enable the <A HREF = "fix_modify.html">fix_modify</A> <I>energy</I> option for
this fix.
