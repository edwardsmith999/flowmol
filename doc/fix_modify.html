<H3>fix_modify command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>fix_modify fix-ID keyword value ... 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>fix-ID = ID of the fix to modify 

<LI>one or more keyword/value pairs may be appended 

<LI>keyword = <I>temp</I> or <I>press</I> or <I>energy</I> 

<PRE>  <I>temp</I> value = compute ID that calculates a temperature
  <I>press</I> value = compute ID that calculates a pressure
  <I>energy</I> value = <I>yes</I> or <I>no</I> 
</PRE>

</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>fix_modify 3 temp myTemp press myPress
fix_modify 1 energy yes 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Modify one or more parameters of a previously defined fix.  Only
specific fix styles support specific parameters.  See the doc pages
for individual fix commands for info on which ones support which
fix_modify parameters.
</P>
<P>The <I>temp</I> keyword is used to determine how a fix computes
temperature.  The specified compute ID must have been previously
defined by the user via the <A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A> command and it must
be a style of compute that calculates a temperature.  All fixes that
compute temperatures define their own compute by default, as described
in their documentation.  Thus this option allows the user to override
the default method for computing T.
</P>
<P>The <I>press</I> keyword is used to determine how a fix computes pressure.
The specified compute ID must have been previously defined by the user
via the <A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A> command and it must be a style of
compute that calculates a pressure.  All fixes that compute pressures
define their own compute by default, as described in their
documentation.  Thus this option allows the user to override the
default method for computing P.
</P>
<P>For fixes that calculate a contribution to the potential energy of the
system, the <I>energy</I> keyword will include that contribution in
thermodynamic output of potential energy.  See the
<A HREF = "thermo_style.html">thermo_style</A> command for info on how potential
energy is output.  The contribution by itself can be printed by using
the keyword f_ID in the thermo_style custom command, where ID is the
fix-ID of the appropriate fix.  Note that you must use this setting
for a fix if you are using it when performing an <A HREF = "minimize.html">energy
minimization</A> and if you want the energy and forces it
produces to be part of the optimization criteria.
