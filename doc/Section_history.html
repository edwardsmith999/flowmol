<P>This section lists features we plan to add to LAMMPS, features of
previous versions of LAMMPS, and features of other parallel molecular
dynamics codes our group has distributed.

</H4>
<P>The <A HREF = "http://lammps.sandia.gov/future.html">Wish list link</A> on the
LAMMPS WWW page gives a list of features we are hoping to add to
LAMMPS in the future, including contact names of individuals you can
email if you are interested in contributing to the developement or
would be a future user of that feature.
</P>
<P>You can also send <A HREF = "http://lammps.sandia.gov/authors.html">email to the
developers</A> if you want to add
your wish to the list.

<H4><A NAME = "hist_2"></A>13.2 Past versions 
</H4>
<P>LAMMPS development began in the mid 1990s under a cooperative research
& development agreement (CRADA) between two DOE labs (Sandia and LLNL)
and 3 companies (Cray, Bristol Myers Squibb, and Dupont). The goal was
to develop a large-scale parallel classical MD code; the coding effort
was led by Steve Plimpton at Sandia.
</P>
<P>After the CRADA ended, a final F77 version, LAMMPS 99, was
released. As development of LAMMPS continued at Sandia, its memory
management was converted to F90; a final F90 version was released as
LAMMPS 2001.
</P>
<P>The current LAMMPS is a rewrite in C++ and was first publicly released
as an open source code in 2004. It includes many new features beyond
those in LAMMPS 99 or 2001. It also includes features from older
parallel MD codes written at Sandia, namely ParaDyn, Warp, and
GranFlow (see below).
</P>
<P>In late 2006 we began merging new capabilities into LAMMPS that were
developed by Aidan Thompson at Sandia for his MD code GRASP, which has
a parallel framework similar to LAMMPS. Most notably, these have
included many-body potentials - Stillinger-Weber, Tersoff, ReaxFF -
and the associated charge-equilibration routines needed for ReaxFF.
</P>
<P>The <A HREF = "http://lammps.sandia.gov/history.html">History link</A> on the 
LAMMPS WWW page gives a timeline of features added to the
C++ open-source version of LAMMPS over the last several years.
</P>
<P>These older codes are available for download from the <A HREF = "http://lammps.sandia.gov">LAMMPS WWW
site</A>, except for Warp & GranFlow which were primarily used
internally.  A brief listing of their features is given here.
