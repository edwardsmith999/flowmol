<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Perform the charge equilibration (QEq) method as described in <A HREF = "#Rappe">(Rappe
and Goddard)</A> and formulated in <A HREF = "#Nakano">(Nakano)</A> (also 
known as the matrix inversion method)
and in <A HREF = "#Rick">(Rick and Stuart)</A> (also known as the extended 
Lagrangian method) based on the electronegativity equilization principle.  
These fixes can be used with any potential in LAMMPS, so long as it defines and
uses charges on each atom and that QEq parameters are provided.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: The <A HREF = "fix_qeq_comb.html">fix qeq/comb</A>
command should be used to perform charge equliibration with the <A HREF = "pair_comb.html">COMB
potential</A>.  The <A HREF = "fix_qeq_reax.html">fix qeq/reax</A>
command can be used to perform charge equilibration with the <A HREF = "pair_reax_c.html">ReaxFF force
field</A>, although fix qeq/shielded yields exact same 
results as fix qeq/reax if <I>Nevery</I>, cutoff</I>, and <I>tolerance</I> are the same.
</P>
<P>The QEq method minimizes the electrostatic energy of the system (or 
equalizes the derivative of energy with respect to charge of all the 
atoms) by adjusting the partial charge on individual atoms based on 
interactions with their neighbors within <I>cutoff</I>.
It reqires some parameters for each atom type provided in a file 
specified by <I>params</I>.  First line of the file should be the unit 
style of these parameters.  These
fixes support real, metal, si, cgs, and electron units.  Using lj, 
micro, and nano units will result in an error.
Each of the following lines should be formatted as follows:
</P>
<PRE>itype chi eta gamma zeta qcore 
</PRE>
<P>where <I>itype</I> is the atom type from 1 to Ntypes, <I>chi</I> denotes the
electronegativity in energy units, <I>eta</I> denotes the self-Coulomb
potential in energy units, <I>gamma</I> denotes the shielded Coulomb 
constant defined by <A HREF = "#vanDuin">ReaxFF force field</A> in distance units, 
<I>zeta</I> denotes the Slater type orbital exponent defined by the 
<A HREF = "#Streitz">Streitz-Mintmire</A> potential (not yet available in LAMMPS) 
in reverse distance units, and <I>qcore</I> denotes the charge of the 
nucleus defined by the Streitz-Mintmire potential in charge units.
</P>
<P>The <I>qeq/point</I> style describes partial charges on atoms as point charges.
Interaction between a pair of charged particles is 1/r, which is the simplest
description of the interaction between charges.  Only <I>chi</I> and <I>eta</I> 
parameters in the <I>params</I> file are used.  Note that Coulomb catastrophe 
can occur if repulsion between the pair of charged particles is too weak.
This style solves partial charges on atoms via the matrix inversion method.
A tolerance of 1.0e-6 is usually a good number.
</P>
<P>The <I>qeq/shielded</I> style describes partial charges on atoms also as point 
charges, but uses a shielded Coulomb potential to describe
the interaction between a pair of charged particles.  Interaction through 
the shielded Coulomb is given by equation (13) of the 
<A HREF = "#vanDuin">ReaxFF force field</A> paper.  The shielding accounts for charge overlap 
between charged particles at small separation.  This style is the same as 
<A HREF = "fix_qeq_reax.html">fix qeq/reax</A>, and can be used with 
<A HREF = "pair_reax_c.html">pair_style reax/c</A>.  Only <I>chi</I>, <I>eta</I>, and <I>gamma</I> parameters 
in the <I>params</I> file are used.
This style solves partial charges on atoms via the matrix inversion method.
A tolerance of 1.0e-6 is usually a good number.
</P>
<P>The <I>qeq/slater</I> style describes partial charges on atoms as spherical 
charge densities centered around atoms via the Slater 1<I>s</I> orbital, so that 
the interaction between a pair of charged particles is the product of two 
Slater 1<I>s</I> orbitals.  The expression for the Slater 1<I>s</I> orbital is given under
equation (6) of the <A HREF = "#Streitz">Streitz-Mintmire</A> paper.  <I>chi</I>, <I>eta</I>, <I>zeta</I>, 
and <I>qcore</I> parameters in the <I>params</I> file are used. 
This style solves partial charges on atoms via the matrix inversion method.
A tolerance of 1.0e-6 is usually a good number.
</P>
<P>The <I>qeq/dynamic</I> style describes partial charges on atoms as point charges 
that interact through 1/r, but the extended Lagrangian method is used to solve
partial charges on atoms.  Only <I>chi</I> and <I>eta</I> parameters in the <I>params</I> file 
are used.  Note that Coulomb catastrophe can occur if repulsion between the 
pair of charged particles is too weak.
A tolerance of 1.0e-3 is usually a good number.
</P>
<P>Note that <I>qeq/point</I>, <I>qeq/shielded</I>, and <I>qeq/slater</I> describe different charge
models, whereas the matrix inversion method and the extended Lagrangian method 
(<I>qeq/dynamic</I>) are different solvers.
</P>
<P>Note that the <I>qeq/point</I> and the <I>qeq/dynamic</I> styles both describe charges as 
point charges that interact through 1/r relationship, but solve partial charges 
on atoms using different solvers.  <I>qeq/point</I> and the <I>qeq/dynamic</I> styles should 
yield comparable results if the QEq parameters and <I>Nevery</I>, cutoff</I>, 
and <I>tolerance</I> are the same.  <I>qeq/point</I> is typically faster, but <I>qeq/dynamic</I> 
scales better on larger sizes.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: To avoid the evaluation of the derivative of charge with 
respect to position, which is typically ill-defined, the system should have a
zero net charge.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: Developing QEq parameters (chi, eta, gamma, zeta, and qcore)
is an "art".  Charges on atoms are not guaranteed to equilibrate with arbitrary 
choices of these parameters.  We do not develop these QEq paramters.

<P>No information about these fixes is written to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
files</A>.  No global scalar or vector or per-atom
quantities are stored by these fixes for access by various <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_15">output

be used with the <I>start/stop</I> keywords of the <A HREF = "run.html">run</A> command.

<P>These fixes are part of the USER-QEQ package.  They are only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_3">Making
