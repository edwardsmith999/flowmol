<H3>angle_style charmm command 
</H3>
<H3>angle_style charmm/omp command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>angle_style charmm

<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>angle_style charmm
angle_coeff 1 300.0 107.0 50.0 3.0 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>The <I>charmm</I> angle style uses the potential
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "Eqs/angle_charmm.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P>with an additional Urey_Bradley term based on the distance <I>r</I> between
the 1st and 3rd atoms in the angle.  K, theta0, Kub, and Rub are
coefficients defined for each angle type.
</P>
<P>See <A HREF = "#MacKerell">(MacKerell)</A> for a description of the CHARMM force
field.
</P>
<P>The following coefficients must be defined for each angle type via the
<A HREF = "angle_coeff.html">angle_coeff</A> command as in the example above, or in
the data file or restart files read by the <A HREF = "read_data.html">read_data</A>
or <A HREF = "read_restart.html">read_restart</A> commands:
</P>
<UL><LI>K (energy/radian^2)
<LI>theta0 (degrees)
<LI>K_ub (energy/distance^2)
<LI>r_ub (distance) 
</UL>
<P>Theta0 is specified in degrees, but LAMMPS converts it to radians
internally; hence the units of K are in energy/radian^2.

<P>Styles with a <I>cuda</I>, <I>gpu</I>, <I>intel</I>, <I>kk</I>, <I>omp</I>, or <I>opt</I> suffix are
functionally the same as the corresponding style without the suffix.
They have been optimized to run faster, depending on your available
hardware, as discussed in <A HREF = "Section_accelerate.html">Section_accelerate</A>
of the manual.  The accelerated styles take the same arguments and
should produce the same results, except for round-off and precision
issues.
</P>
<P>These accelerated styles are part of the USER-CUDA, GPU, USER-INTEL,
KOKKOS, USER-OMP and OPT packages, respectively.  They are only
enabled if LAMMPS was built with those packages.  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_3">Making
LAMMPS</A> section for more info.
</P>
<P>You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_7">-suffix command-line
switch</A> when you invoke LAMMPS, or you can
use the <A HREF = "suffix.html">suffix</A> command in your input script.
</P>
<P>See <A HREF = "Section_accelerate.html">Section_accelerate</A> of the manual for
more instructions on how to use the accelerated styles effectively.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This angle style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
MOLECULAR package (which it is by default).  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_3">Making
LAMMPS</A> section for more info on packages.
