<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>The <I>bop</I> pair style computes Bond-Order Potentials (BOP) based on
quantum mechanical theory incorporating both sigma and pi bondings.
By analytically deriving the BOP from quantum mechanical theory its
transferability to different phases can approach that of quantum
mechanical methods.  This particlular BOP is extremely effective at
modeling III-V and II-VI compounds such as GaAs and CdTe.  This
potential is similar to the original BOP developed by Pettifor
(<A HREF = "#Pettifor_1">Pettifor_1</A>, <A HREF = "#Pettifor_2">Pettifor_2</A>,
<A HREF = "#Pettifor_3">Pettifor_3</A>) and later updated by Murdick, Zhou, and Ward
(<A HREF = "#Murdick">Murdick</A>, <A HREF = "#Ward">Ward</A>).
</P>
<P>The BOP potential consists of three terms:
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "Eqs/pair_bop.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P>where phi_ij(r_ij) is a short-range two-body function representing the
repulsion between a pair of ion cores, beta_(sigma,ij)(r_ij) and
beta_(sigma,ij)(r_ij) are respectively sigma and pi bond ingtegrals,
THETA_(sigma,ij) and THETA_(pi,ij) are sigma and pi bond-orders, and
U_prom is the promotion energy for sp-valent systems.
</P>
<P>The detailed formulas for this potential are given in Ward
(<A HREF = "#Ward">Ward</A>); here we provide only a brief description.
</P>
<P>The repulsive energy phi_ij(r_ij) and the bond integrals
beta_(sigma,ij)(r_ij) and beta_(phi,ij)(r_ij) are functions of the
interatomic distance r_ij between atom i and j.  Each of these
potentials has a smooth cutoff at a radius of r_(cut,ij).  These
smooth cutoffs ensure stable behavior at situations with high sampling
near the cutoff such as melts and surfaces.
</P>
<P>The bond-orders can be viewed as environment-dependent local variables
that are ij bond specific.  The maximum value of the sigma bond-order
(THETA_sigma) is 1, while that of the pi bond-order (THETA_pi) is 2,
attributing to a maximum value of the total bond-order
(THETA_sigma+THETA_pi) of 3.  The sigma and pi bond-orders reflect the
ubiquitous single-, double-, and triple- bond behavior of
chemistry. Their analytical expressions can be derived from tight-
binding theory by recursively expanding an inter-site Green's function
as a continued fraction. To accurately represent the bonding with a
computationally efficient potential formulation suitable for MD
simulations, the derived BOP only takes (and retains) the first two
levels of the recursive representations for both the sigma and the pi
bond-orders. Bond-order terms can be understood in terms of molecular
orbital hopping paths based upon the Cyrot-Lackmann theorem
(<A HREF = "#Pettifor_1">Pettifor_1</A>).  The sigma bond-order with a half-full
valence band filling.  This pi bond-order expression also contains
also contains a three-member ring term that allows implementation of
an asymmetric density of states, which helps to either stabilize or
destabilize close-packed structures.  The pi bond-order includes
hopping paths of length 4.  This enables the incorporation of dihedral
angles effects.
</P>
<P>The cutoffs for the various interactions are defined in the BOP
potential file.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: You must use the <A HREF = "communicate.html">communicate cutoff</A>
command to insure ghost atoms are acquired at a distance 3x further
than the largest BOP cutoff (for a particular pair of elements).
E.g. if the BOP cutoff is 4.9 Angstroms, then the ghost atom
communication needs to be 14.7 Angstroms or greater as in the example
above.  This is because the BOP formulation uses neighbors of
neighbors of neighbors to enumerate all the required many-body
interactions.  LAMMPS will generate an error if you do not use an
appropriate setting for the <A HREF = "communicate.html">communicate cutoff</A>
command.
</P>
<P>Several options can be specified as keywords with the pair_style
command.
</P>
<P>The <I>table</I> keyword tells LAMMPS what format the BOP potential file is
in.  The default is a non-tabulated form.  If the <I>table</I> keyword is
used, the file is in a tabulated form containing pre-tabulated pair
functions for phi_ij(r_ij), beta_(sigma,ij)(r_ij), and
beta_(pi,ij)(r_ij).  This allows you to use your own functional
form for various interactions.
</P>
<P>The <I>save</I> keyword gives you the option to calculate and store in
advance a set of distances, angles, and derivatives of angles.  The
default is to not do this, but to calculate the various quantities
on-the-fly each time they are needed.  The former may be faster, but
takes more memory.  The latter requires less memory, but may be
slower.  It is best to test this option to see if it makes a
difference on your machine for the specific problem you are modeling.
</P>
<P>The <I>sigmaoff</I> keyword optimizes the BOP equations for the case of
a_sigma = 0.  For some published BOP potentials, a_sigma = 0 and
several terms in the BOP equationas drop out.  If this is the case,
specifying <I>sigmaoff</I> will typically speed up the BOP pair style.
</P>
<HR>

<P>Only a single pair_coeff command is used with the <I>bop</I> style which
specifies a BOP potential file, with parameters for all needed
elements.  These are mapped to LAMMPS atom types by specifying
N additional arguments after the filename in the pair_coeff command,
where N is the number of LAMMPS atom types:
</P>
<UL><LI>filename
<LI>N element names = mapping of BOP elements to atom types 
</UL>
<P>As an example, imagine the CdTe.bop file has BOP values for Cd
and Te.  If your LAMMPS simulation has 4 atoms types and you want the
1st 3 to be Cd, and the 4th to be Te, you would use the following
pair_coeff command:
</P>
<PRE>pair_coeff * * CdTe Cd Cd Cd Te 
</PRE>
<P>The 1st 2 arguments must be * * so as to span all LAMMPS atom types.
The first three Cd arguments map LAMMPS atom types 1,2,3 to the Cd
element in the BOP file.  The final Te argument maps LAMMPS atom type
4 to the Te element in the BOP file.  If a mapping value is specified
as NULL, the mapping is not performed.  This can be used when a
<I>bop</I> potential is used as part of the <I>hybrid</I> pair style.  The
NULL values are placeholders for atom types that will be used with
other potentials.
</P>
<P>BOP files in the <I>potentials</I> directory of the LAMMPS distribution
have a ".bop" or ".bop.table" suffix, depending on whether they are of
the non-tabulated or tabulated form, as described above.
</P>
