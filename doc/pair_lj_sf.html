<H3>pair_style lj/sf command 
</H3>
<H3>pair_style lj/sf/omp command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>pair_style lj/sf cutoff 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>cutoff = global cutoff for Lennard-Jones interactions (distance units) 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>pair_style lj/sf 2.5
pair_coeff * * 1.0 1.0
pair_coeff 1 1 1.0 1.0 3.0 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Style <I>lj/sf</I> computes a truncated and force-shifted LJ interaction
(Shifted Force Lennard-Jones), so that both the potential and the
force go continuously to zero at the cutoff <A HREF = "#Toxvaerd">(Toxvaerd)</A>:
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "Eqs/pair_lj_sf.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P>The following coefficients must be defined for each pair of atoms
types via the <A HREF = "pair_coeff.html">pair_coeff</A> command as in the examples
above, or in the data file or restart files read by the
<A HREF = "read_data.html">read_data</A> or <A HREF = "read_restart.html">read_restart</A>
commands, or by mixing as described below:
</P>
<UL><LI>epsilon (energy units)
<LI>sigma (distance units)
<LI>cutoff (distance units) 
</UL>
<P>The last coefficient is optional. If not specified, the global
LJ cutoff specified in the pair_style command is used.

<P>Styles with a <I>cuda</I>, <I>gpu</I>, <I>omp</I>, or <I>opt</I> suffix are functionally
the same as the corresponding style without the suffix.  They have
been optimized to run faster, depending on your available hardware, as
discussed in <A HREF = "Section_accelerate.html">Section_accelerate</A> of the
manual.  The accelerated styles take the same arguments and should
produce the same results, except for round-off and precision issues.
</P>
<P>These accelerated styles are part of the USER-CUDA, GPU, USER-OMP and OPT
packages, respectively.  They are only enabled if LAMMPS was built with
those packages.  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_3">Making LAMMPS</A>
section for more info.
</P>
<P>You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_7">-suffix command-line
switch</A> when you invoke LAMMPS, or you can
use the <A HREF = "suffix.html">suffix</A> command in your input script.
</P>
<P>See <A HREF = "Section_accelerate.html">Section_accelerate</A> of the manual for
more instructions on how to use the accelerated styles effectively.
</P>

<P><B>Mixing, shift, table, tail correction, restart, rRESPA info</B>:
</P>
<P>For atom type pairs I,J and I != J, the epsilon and sigma
coefficients and cutoff distance for this pair style can be mixed.
Rin is a cutoff value and is mixed like the cutoff. The
default mix value is <I>geometric</I>.  See the "pair_modify" command for
details.
</P>
<P>The <A HREF = "pair_modify.html">pair_modify</A> shift option is not relevant for
this pair style, since the pair interaction goes to 0.0 at the cutoff.
</P>
<P>The <A HREF = "pair_modify.html">pair_modify</A> table option is not relevant
for this pair style.
</P>
<P>This pair style does not support the <A HREF = "pair_modify.html">pair_modify</A>
tail option for adding long-range tail corrections to energy and
pressure, since the energy of the pair interaction is smoothed to 0.0
at the cutoff.
</P>
<P>This pair style writes its information to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
files</A>, so pair_style and pair_coeff commands do not need
to be specified in an input script that reads a restart file.
</P>
<P>This pair style can only be used via the <I>pair</I> keyword of the
<A HREF = "run_style.html">run_style respa</A> command.  It does not support the
<I>inner</I>, <I>middle</I>, <I>outer</I> keywords.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This pair style is part of the USER-MISC package.  It is only enabled
if LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_3">Making
LAMMPS</A> section for more info.
