<H4>5.3.6 OPT package 
</H4>
<P>The OPT package was developed by James Fischer (High Performance
Technologies), David Richie, and Vincent Natoli (Stone Ridge
Technologies).  It contains a handful of pair styles whose compute()
methods were rewritten in C++ templated form to reduce the overhead
due to if tests and other conditional code.
</P>
<P>Here is a quick overview of how to use the OPT package:
</P>
<UL><LI>include the OPT package and build LAMMPS
<LI>use OPT pair styles in your input script 
</UL>
<P>The last step can be done using the "-sf opt" <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_7">command-line
switch</A>.  Or the effect of the "-sf" switch
can be duplicated by adding a <A HREF = "suffix.html">suffix opt</A> command to your
input script.
</P>
<P><B>Required hardware/software:</B>
</P>
<P>None.
</P>
<P><B>Building LAMMPS with the OPT package:</B>
</P>
<P>Include the package and build LAMMPS:
</P>
<PRE>cd lammps/src
make yes-opt
make machine 
</PRE>
<P>If you are using Intel compilers, then the CCFLAGS setting in your
src/MAKE/Makefile.machine needs to include "-restrict".
</P>
<P><B>Run with the OPT package from the command line:</B>
</P>
<P>Use the "-sf opt" <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_7">command-line switch</A>,
which will automatically append "opt" to styles that support it.
</P>
<PRE>lmp_machine -sf opt -in in.script
mpirun -np 4 lmp_machine -sf opt -in in.script 
</PRE>
<P><B>Or run with the OPT package by editing an input script:</B>
</P>
<P>Use the <A HREF = "suffix.html">suffix opt</A> command, or you can explicitly add an
"opt" suffix to individual styles in your input script, e.g.
</P>
<PRE>pair_style lj/cut/opt 2.5 
</PRE>
<P><B>Speed-ups to expect:</B>
</P>
<P>You should see a reduction in the "Pair time" value printed at the end
of a run.  On most machines for reasonable problem sizes, it will be a
5 to 20% savings.
</P>
<P><B>Guidelines for best performance:</B>
</P>
<P>None.  Just try out an OPT pair style to see how it performs.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>None.
