<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This fix provides functionality to implement a QM/MM coupling of 
LAMMPS a quantum mechanical code. The current implementation only
supports an ONIOM style mechanical coupling to the Quantum ESPRESSO
plane wave DFT package. Electrostatic coupling is in preparation
and the interface was written in a way, that coupling to other QM
codes is possible without changes to the LAMMPS codes itself. The
interface code is made available at this early stage of development
in order to encourage contributions for interfaces to other QM
codes before the LAMMPS side of the implementation is finalized
and will be much more difficult to adapt.
</P>
<P>Details about how to use this fix are currently documented in the 
description of the QM/MM interface code itself in lib/qmmm/README.

<P><B>Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:</B>
</P>
<P>No information about this fix is written to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
files</A>.  None of the <A HREF = "fix_modify.html">fix_modify</A> options
are relevant to this fix.  No global scalar or vector or per-atom
quantities are stored by this fix for access by various <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_15">output
commands</A>.  No parameter of this fix can
be used with the <I>start/stop</I> keywords of the <A HREF = "run.html">run</A> command.
This fix is not invoked during <A HREF = "minimize.html">energy minimization</A>.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This fix is part of the USER-QMMM package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package. It also requires building a
library provided with LAMMPS.  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_3">Making
LAMMPS</A> section for more info.
</P>
<P>The fix is only functional when LAMMPS is built as a library and
linked with a compatible QM program and a QM/MM frontend into a QM/MM
executable.
