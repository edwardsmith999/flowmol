<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Define a computation that simply stores atom attributes for each atom
in the group.  This is useful so that the values can be used by other
<A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_15">output commands</A> that take computes as
inputs.  See for example, the <A HREF = "compute_reduce.html">compute reduce</A>,
<A HREF = "fix_ave_atom.html">fix ave/atom</A>, <A HREF = "fix_ave_histo.html">fix ave/histo</A>,
<A HREF = "fix_ave_spatial.html">fix ave/spatial</A>, and <A HREF = "variable.html">atom-style
variable</A> commands.
</P>
<P>The list of possible attributes is the same as that used by the <A HREF = "dump.html">dump
custom</A> command, which describes their meaning, with some
additional quantities that are only defined for certain <A HREF = "atom_style.html">atom
styles</A>.  Basically, this list gives your input script
access to any per-atom quantity stored by LAMMPS.
</P>
<P>The values are stored in a per-atom vector or array as discussed
below.  Zeroes are stored for atoms not in the specified group or for
quantities that are not defined for a particular particle in the group
(e.g. <I>shapex</I> if the particle is not an ellipsoid).
</P>
<P>The additional quantities only accessible via this command, and not
directly via the <A HREF = "dump.html">dump custom</A> command, are as follows.
</P>
<P><I>Shapex</I>, <I>shapey</I>, and <I>shapez</I> are defined for ellipsoidal particles
and define the 3d shape of each particle.
</P>
<P><I>Quatw</I>, <I>quati</I>, <I>quatj</I>, and <I>quatk</I> are defined for ellipsoidal
particles and body particles and store the 4-vector quaternion
representing the orientation of each particle.  See the <A HREF = "set.html">set</A>
command for an explanation of the quaternion vector.
</P>
<P><I>End1x</I>, <I>end1y</I>, <I>end1z</I>, <I>end2x</I>, <I>end2y</I>, <I>end2z</I>, are defined for
line segment particles and define the end points of each line segment.
</P>
<P><I>Corner1x</I>, <I>corner1y</I>, <I>corner1z</I>, <I>corner2x</I>, <I>corner2y</I>,
<I>corner2z</I>, <I>corner3x</I>, <I>corner3y</I>, <I>corner3z</I>, are defined for
triangular particles and define the corner points of each triangle.
</P>
<P><I>nbonds</I> is available for all molecular atom styles and refers to
the number of explicit bonds attached to an atom.
</P>
<P>The <I>i_name</I> and <I>d_name</I> attributes refer to custom integer and
floating-point properties that have been added to each atom via the
<A HREF = "fix_property_atom.html">fix property/atom</A> command.  When that command
is used specific names are given to each attribute which are what is
specified as the "name" portion of <I>i_name</I> or <I>d_name</I>.
</P>
<P><B>Output info:</B>
</P>
<P>This compute calculates a per-atom vector or per-atom array depending
on the number of input values.  If a single input is specified, a
per-atom vector is produced.  If two or more inputs are specified, a
per-atom array is produced where the number of columns = the number of
inputs.  The vector or array can be accessed by any command that uses
per-atom values from a compute as input.  See <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_15">this
section</A> for an overview of LAMMPS output
options.
</P>
<P>The vector or array values will be in whatever <A HREF = "units.html">units</A> the
corresponding attribute is in, e.g. velocity units for vx, charge
units for q, etc.
