compute damage/atom command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID group-ID damage/atom :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "compute"_compute.html command
damage/atom = style name of this compute command :ul

[Examples:]

compute 1 all damage/atom :pre

[Description:]

Define a computation that calculates the per-atom damage for each atom
in a group.  Please see the "PDLAMMPS user
guide"_http://www.sandia.gov/~mlparks/papers/PDLAMMPS.pdf for a formal
definition of "damage" and more details about Peridynamics as it is
implemented in LAMMPS.

The value of the damage will be 0.0 for atoms not in the specified
compute group.

[Output info:]

This compute calculates a per-atom vector, which can be accessed by
any command that uses per-atom values from a compute as input.  See
"Section_howto 15"_Section_howto.html#howto_15 for an overview of
LAMMPS output options.

The per-atom vector values will be a number >= 0.0, as explained
above.

[Restrictions:]

This compute is part of the PERI package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3 section for more info.

[Default:] none
