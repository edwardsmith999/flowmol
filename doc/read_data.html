<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Read in a data file containing information LAMMPS needs to run a
simulation.  The file can be ASCII text or a gzipped text file
(detected by a .gz suffix).  This is one of 3 ways to specify initial
atom coordinates; see the <A HREF = "read_restart.html">read_restart</A> and
<A HREF = "create_atoms.html">create_atoms</A> commands for alternative methods.
Also see the explanation of the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_7">-restart command-line
switch</A> which can convert a restart file to
a data file.
</P>
<P>The structure of the data file is important, though many settings and
sections are optional or can come in any order.  See the examples
directory for sample data files for different problems.
</P>
<P>A data file has a header and a body.  The header appears first.  The
first line of the header is always skipped; it typically contains a
description of the file.  Then lines are read one at a time.  Lines
can have a trailing comment starting with '#' that is ignored.  If the
line is blank (only whitespace after comment is deleted), it is
skipped.  If the line contains a header keyword, the corresponding
value(s) is read from the line.  If it doesn't contain a header
keyword, the line begins the body of the file.
</P>
<P>The body of the file contains zero or more sections.  The first line
of a section has only a keyword.  This line can have a trailing
comment starting with '#' that is either ignored or can be used to
check for a style match, as described below.  The next line is
skipped.  The remaining lines of the section contain values.  The
number of lines depends on the section keyword as described below.
Zero or more blank lines can be used between sections.  Sections can
appear in any order, with a few exceptions as noted below.
</P>
<P>The keyword <I>fix</I> can be used one or more times.  Each usage specifies
a fix that will be used to process a specific portion of the data
file.  Any header line containing <I>header-string</I> and any section with
a name containing <I>section-string</I> will be passed to the specified
fix.  See the <A HREF = "fix_property_atom.html">fix property/atom</A> command for
an example of a fix that operates in this manner.  The doc page for
the fix defines the syntax of the header line(s) and section(s) that
it reads from the data file.  Note that the <I>header-string</I> can be
specified as NULL, in which case no header lines are passed to the
fix.  This means that it can infer the length of its Section from
standard header settings, such as the number of atoms.
</P>
<P>The formatting of individual lines in the data file (indentation,
spacing between words and numbers) is not important except that header
and section keywords (e.g. atoms, xlo xhi, Masses, Bond Coeffs) must
be capitalized as shown and can't have extra white space between their
words - e.g. two spaces or a tab between the 2 words in "xlo xhi" or
the 2 words in "Bond Coeffs", is not valid.
</P>
<HR>

<P>These are the recognized header keywords.  Header lines can come in
any order.  The value(s) are read from the beginning of the line.
Thus the keyword <I>atoms</I> should be in a line like "1000 atoms"; the
keyword <I>ylo yhi</I> should be in a line like "-10.0 10.0 ylo yhi"; the
keyword <I>xy xz yz</I> should be in a line like "0.0 5.0 6.0 xy xz yz".
All these settings have a default value of 0, except the lo/hi box
size defaults are -0.5 and 0.5.  A line need only appear if the value
is different than the default.

</UL>
<P>The initial simulation box size is determined by the lo/hi settings.
In any dimension, the system may be periodic or non-periodic; see the
<A HREF = "boundary.html">boundary</A> command.  When the simulation box is created
it is also partitioned into a regular 3d grid of rectangular bricks,
one per processor, based on the number of processors being used and
the settings of the <A HREF = "processors.html">processors</A> command.  The
partitioning can later be changed by the <A HREF = "balance.html">balance</A> or
<A HREF = "fix_balance.html">fix balance</A> commands.
</P>
<P>If the <I>xy xz yz</I> line does not appear, LAMMPS will set up an
axis-aligned (orthogonal) simulation box.  If the line does appear,
LAMMPS creates a non-orthogonal simulation domain shaped as a
parallelepiped with triclinic symmetry.  The parallelepiped has its
"origin" at (xlo,ylo,zlo) and is defined by 3 edge vectors starting
from the origin given by A = (xhi-xlo,0,0); B = (xy,yhi-ylo,0); C =
(xz,yz,zhi-zlo).  <I>Xy,xz,yz</I> can be 0.0 or positive or negative values
and are called "tilt factors" because they are the amount of
displacement applied to faces of an originally orthogonal box to
transform it into the parallelepiped.
</P>
<P>By default, the tilt factors (xy,xz,yz) can not skew the box more than
half the distance of the corresponding parallel box length.  For
example, if xlo = 2 and xhi = 12, then the x box length is 10 and the
xy tilt factor must be between -5 and 5.  Similarly, both xz and yz
must be between -(xhi-xlo)/2 and +(yhi-ylo)/2.  Note that this is not
a limitation, since if the maximum tilt factor is 5 (as in this
example), then configurations with tilt = ..., -15, -5, 5, 15, 25,
... are all geometrically equivalent.  If you wish to define a box
with tilt factors that exceed these limits, you can use the <A HREF = "box.html">box
tilt</A> command, with a setting of <I>large</I>; a setting of
<I>small</I> is the default.
</P>
<P>See <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_12">Section_howto 12</A> of the doc pages
for a geometric description of triclinic boxes, as defined by LAMMPS,
and how to transform these parameters to and from other commonly used
triclinic representations.
</P>
<P>When a triclinic system is used, the simulation domain should normally
be periodic in the dimension that the tilt is applied to, which is
given by the second dimension of the tilt factor (e.g. y for xy tilt).
This is so that pairs of atoms interacting across that boundary will
have one of them shifted by the tilt factor.  Periodicity is set by
the <A HREF = "boundary.html">boundary</A> command.  For example, if the xy tilt
factor is non-zero, then the y dimension should be periodic.
Similarly, the z dimension should be periodic if xz or yz is non-zero.
LAMMPS does not require this periodicity, but you may lose atoms if
this is not the case.
</P>
<P>Also note that if your simulation will tilt the box, e.g. via the <A HREF = "fix_deform.html">fix
deform</A> command, the simulation box must be setup to
be triclinic, even if the tilt factors are initially 0.0.  You can
also change an orthogonal box to a triclinic box or vice versa by
using the <A HREF = "change_box.html">change box</A> command with its <I>ortho</I> and
<I>triclinic</I> options.
</P>
<P>For 2d simulations, the <I>zlo zhi</I> values should be set to bound the z
coords for atoms that appear in the file; the default of -0.5 0.5 is
valid if all z coords are 0.0.  For 2d triclinic simulations, the xz
and yz tilt factors must be 0.0.
</P>
<P>If the system is periodic (in a dimension), then atom coordinates can
be outside the bounds (in that dimension); they will be remapped (in a
periodic sense) back inside the box.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: If the system is non-periodic (in a dimension), then
all atoms in the data file must have coordinates (in that dimension)
that are "greater than or equal to" the lo value and "less than or
equal to" the hi value.  If the non-periodic dimension is of style
"fixed" (see the <A HREF = "boundary.html">boundary</A> command), then the atom
coords must be strictly "less than" the hi value, due to the way
LAMMPS assign atoms to processors.  Note that you should not make the
lo/hi values radically smaller/larger than the extent of the atoms.
For example, if your atoms extend from 0 to 50, you should not specify
the box bounds as -10000 and 10000.  This is because LAMMPS uses the
specified box size to layout the 3d grid of processors.  A huge
(mostly empty) box will be sub-optimal for performance when using
"fixed" boundary conditions (see the <A HREF = "boundary.html">boundary</A>
command).  When using "shrink-wrap" boundary conditions (see the
<A HREF = "boundary.html">boundary</A> command), a huge (mostly empty) box may cause
a parallel simulation to lose atoms the first time that LAMMPS
shrink-wraps the box around the atoms.
</P>
<P>The "extra bond per atom" setting (angle, dihedral, improper) is only
needed if new bonds (angles, dihedrals, impropers) will be added to
the system when a simulation runs, e.g. by using the <A HREF = "fix_bond_create.html">fix
bond/create</A> command.  This will pre-allocate
space in LAMMPS data structures for storing the new bonds (angles,
dihedrals, impropers).
</P>
<P>The "extra special per atom" setting is typically only needed if new
bonds/angles/etc will be added to the system, e.g. by using the <A HREF = "fix_bond_create.html">fix
bond/create</A> command.  Or if entire new molecules
will be added to the system, e.g. by using the <A HREF = "fix_deposit.html">fix
deposit</A> or <A HREF = "fix_pour.html">fix pour</A> commands, which
will have more special 1-2,1-3,1-4 neighbors than any other molecules
defined in the data file.  Using this setting will pre-allocate space
in the LAMMPS data structures for storing these neighbors.  See the
<A HREF = "special_bonds.html">special_bonds</A> and <A HREF = "molecule.html">molecule</A> doc
pages for more discussion of 1-2,1-3,1-4 neighbors.
</P>
<P>The "ellipsoids" and "lines" and "triangles" and "bodies" settings are
only used with <A HREF = "atom_style.html">atom_style ellipsoid or line or tri or
body</A> and specify how many of the atoms are
finite-size ellipsoids or lines or triangles or bodies; the remainder
are point particles.  See the discussion of ellipsoidflag and the
<I>Ellipsoids</I> section below.  See the discussion of lineflag and the
<I>Lines</I> section below.  See the discussion of triangleflag and the
<I>Triangles</I> section below.  See the discussion of bodyflag and the
<I>Bodies</I> section below.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: For <A HREF = "atom_style.html">atom_style template</A>, the
molecular topology (bonds,angles,etc) is contained in the molecule
templates read-in by the <A HREF = "molecule.html">molecule</A> command.  This means
you cannot set the <I>bonds</I>, <I>angles</I>, etc header keywords in the data
file, nor can you define <I>Bonds</I>, <I>Angles</I>, etc sections as discussed
below.  You can set the <I>bond types</I>, <I>angle types</I>, etc header
keywords, though it is not necessary.  If specified, they must match
the maximum values defined in any of the template molecules.

</P>
<P>For 2d simulations specify z as 0.0, or a value within the <I>zlo zhi</I>
setting in the data file header.
</P>
<P>The atom-ID is used to identify the atom throughout the simulation and
in dump files.  Normally, it is a unique value from 1 to Natoms for
each atom.  Unique values larger than Natoms can be used, but they
will cause extra memory to be allocated on each processor, if an atom
map array is used, but not if an atom map hash is used; see the
<A HREF = "atom_modify.html">atom_modify</A> command for details.  If an atom map is
not used (e.g. an atomic system with no bonds), and you don't care if
unique atom IDs appear in dump files, then the atom-IDs can all be set
to 0.
</P>
<P>The molecule ID is a 2nd identifier attached to an atom.  Normally, it
is a number from 1 to N, identifying which molecule the atom belongs
to.  It can be 0 if it is an unbonded atom or if you don't care to
keep track of molecule assignments.
</P>
<P>The diameter specifies the size of a finite-size spherical particle.
It can be set to 0.0, which means that atom is a point particle.
</P>
<P>The ellipsoidflag, lineflag, triangleflag, and bodyflag determine
whether the particle is a finite-size ellipsoid or line or triangle or
body of finite size, or whether the particle is a point particle.
Additional attributes must be defined for each ellipsoid, line,
triangle, or body in the corresponding <I>Ellipsoids</I>, <I>Lines</I>,
<I>Triangles</I>, or <I>Bodies</I> section.
</P>
<P>The <I>template-index</I> and <I>template-atom</I> are only defined used by
<A HREF = "atom_style.html">atom_style template</A>.  In this case the
<A HREF = "molecule.html">molecule</A> command is used to define a molecule template
which contains one or more molecules.  If an atom belongs to one of
those molecules, its <I>template-index</I> and <I>template-atom</I> are both set
to positive integers; if not the values are both 0.  The
<I>template-index</I> is which molecule (1 to Nmols) the atom belongs to.
The <I>template-atom</I> is which atom (1 to Natoms) within the molecule
the atom is.
</P>
<P>Some pair styles and fixes and computes that operate on finite-size
particles allow for a mixture of finite-size and point particles.  See
the doc pages of individual commands for details.
</P>
<P>For finite-size particles, the density is used in conjunction with the
particle volume to set the mass of each particle as mass = density *
volume.  In this context, volume can be a 3d quantity (for spheres or
ellipsoids), a 2d quantity (for triangles), or a 1d quantity (for line
segments).  If the volume is 0.0, meaning a point particle, then the
density value is used as the mass.  One exception is for the body atom
style, in which case the mass of each particle (body or point
particle) is specified explicitly.  This is because the volume of the
body is unknown.
</P>
<P>For atom_style hybrid, following the 5 initial values (ID,type,x,y,z),
specific values for each sub-style must be listed.  The order of the
sub-styles is the same as they were listed in the
<A HREF = "atom_style.html">atom_style</A> command.  The sub-style specific values
are those that are not the 5 standard ones (ID,type,x,y,z).  For
example, for the "charge" sub-style, a "q" value would appear.  For
the "full" sub-style, a "molecule-ID" and "q" would appear.  These are
listed in the same order they appear as listed above.  Thus if
</P>
<PRE>atom_style hybrid charge sphere 
</PRE>
<P>were used in the input script, each atom line would have these fields:
</P>
<PRE>atom-ID atom-type x y z q diameter density 
</PRE>
<P>Note that if a non-standard value is defined by multiple sub-styles,
it must appear mutliple times in the atom line.  E.g. the atom line
for atom_style hybrid dipole full would list "q" twice:
</P>
<PRE>atom-ID atom-type x y z q mux muy myz molecule-ID q 
</PRE>
<P>Atom lines specify the (x,y,z) coordinates of atoms.  These can be
inside or outside the simulation box.  When the data file is read,
LAMMPS wraps coordinates outside the box back into the box for
dimensions that are periodic.  As discussed above, if an atom is
outside the box in a non-periodic dimension, it will be lost.
</P>
<P>LAMMPS always stores atom coordinates as values which are inside the
simulation box.  It also stores 3 flags which indicate which image of
the simulation box (in each dimension) the atom would be in if its
coordinates were unwrapped across periodic boundaries.  An image flag
of 0 means the atom is still inside the box when unwrapped.  A value
of 2 means add 2 box lengths to get the unwrapped coordinate.  A value
of -1 means subtract 1 box length to get the unwrapped coordinate.
LAMMPS updates these flags as atoms cross periodic boundaries during
the simulation.  The <A HREF = "dump.html">dump</A> command can output atom atom
coordinates in wrapped or unwrapped form, as well as the 3 image
flags.
</P>
<P>In the data file, atom lines (all lines or none of them) can
optionally list 3 trailing integer values (nx,ny,nz), which are used
to initialize the atom's image flags.  If nx,ny,nz values are not
listed in the data file, LAMMPS initializes them to 0.  Note that the
image flags are immediately updated if an atom's coordinates need to
wrapped back into the simulation box.
</P>
<P>It is only important to set image flags correctly in a data file if a
simulation model relies on unwrapped coordinates for some calculation;
otherwise they can be left unspecified.  Examples of LAMMPS commands
that use unwrapped coordinates internally are as follows:
</P>
<UL><LI>Atoms in a rigid body (see <A HREF = "fix_rigid.html">fix rigid</A>, <A HREF = "fix_rigid.html">fix
rigid/small</A>) must have consistent image flags, so that
when the atoms are unwrapped, they are near each other, i.e. as a
single body. 

<LI>If the <A HREF = "replicate.html">replicate</A> command is used to generate a larger
system, image flags must be consistent for bonded atoms when the bond
crosses a periodic boundary.  I.e. the values of the image flags
should be different by 1 (in the appropriate dimension) for the two
atoms in such a bond. 

<LI>If you plan to <A HREF = "dump.html">dump</A> image flags and perform post-analysis
that will unwrap atom coordinates, it may be important that a
continued run (restarted from a data file) begins with image flags
that are consistent with the previous run.
