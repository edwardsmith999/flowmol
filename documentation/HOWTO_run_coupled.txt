Quick  description of the steps needed for a coupled run. 


0) Geometries mapping:

   MD needs to use a global domain that is an integer number of
   initial FCC cells.  The side of a FCC cell is fixed by the density
   l = 1.0/(density/4)**(1.0/3.0) ( in 3D, sigma units). An CFD cell
   should have the length around 5 sigma in x and y direction and is
   basically free in z direction (for the simple Couette test).

   For the Couette solver we chose 10 CFD cells in X, 7 in Y and 1 in
   Z; density is 0.8.  

   MD domain in FCC cells is chosen to 32x16x20.

   MD covers all CFD in X direction and first three CFD cell in Y
   (without the boundary cells).  In Y direction we add to MD domain
   two more CFD cells below physical CFD, one for boundary condition,
   and one for molecule interaction with the wall.  Hence the MD
   region below CFD y=0 boundary has the length 16*l-3*(32*l/10). This
   parameter is set in coupler_dCSE/src_code/coupler_md_setup.f90, but
   if you change any of the above parameters you need to reset
   DY_PURE_MD variable.


1) set the desired number of processors in MD_dCSE/src_code/param.inc
   (N.B. at the moment only npx can be > 1 and it must me a divisor of
   total number of initial FCC cells along x: 1,2,4,8,16)

2) edit MD_dCSE/src_code/mlecular_properties.f90 go to subroutine
   setup_tag and set fixedistbottom(2) = 1.d0**cellsidelength(2)

3) compile both code from coupler_dCSE/src_code directory (N.B. if the
   MD code was used uncoupled previously give a `make clean' in
   MD_dCSE/src_code to enable the couple modules).

4) create a directory for computation and results, let's call it
   test1.  Under test1 create the following directories: md_data,
   md_data/results, couette_data, couette_data/results.

5) copy the executable files md.exe, continuum.exe in test1 

6) copy MD.in in md_data/ and set the following input quantities
   INITALUNITS to 32, 16, 20; NSTEPS to 50, PERIODIC to 1,0,1;
   INITISE_STEPS to 1

7) copy input_continuum in couette_data/. in
   couette_data/input_continuum and set domain size in x to 54.7189;
   domain size in y to 38.3033

8) run the both code using parallel launcher in multiple programs,
   multiple data mode.
