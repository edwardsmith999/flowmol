Topology_test contains a standalone code that is designed to perform the
communications and mapping setup of the coupler, before performing gather,
scatter, send and recv processes with dummy arrays. 

Module source files are symbolically linked to the src_code directory. 

The python script "run.py" reads the input file "procs", and makes a system
call to mpiexec with the appropriate number of processors.
