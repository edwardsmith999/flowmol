This contains the setup files for a DNS simulation of Couette flow at Re=400,
counter sliding walls and the minimum dimensions required to sustain turbulent
flow (consistent with the minimal flow unit of J. M. Hamilton, J. Kim and F.
Waleffe, Regeneration mechanisms of near-wall turbulence structures, J. Fluid
Mech. 287 (1995). Identification and numerical study of organized dynamics in
low-Reynolds plane Couette flow in small aspect ratio cells).

In order to get repeating turbulent structures, random noise is used to trigger
transition at a Reynolds number of 5000 and this is gradually decreased to
Re=400 in steps of 5000,2500,1000 and 400.  An initial snapshot file for Re=400
is included, obtained from a run of 10000 timesteps.


Running nek5000 with turbChannel case
=====================================

In the following, $NEK5000 is shorthand for cpl-library/nek5000

The workflow is typically:

    1. define the box geomtery in file turbChannel.box

    2. build binary "tools" in $NEK5000/trunk/tools/:

        cd $NEK5000/trunk/tools/
        ./maketools all

    3. call "genbox" from the binary files built by maketools above
       to create box.rea:
          
        cd $NEK5000/runs/
        ../trunk/tools/bin/genbox       (input name "turbChannel.box")

    4. rename box.rea to turbChannel.rea:

        mv box.rea turbChannel.rea

    5. call "genmap" to create turbChannel.map

        ../trunk/tools/bin/genmap       (input name "turbChannel", 
                                         input mesh tolerance 0.2)

    6. call makenek wrapper:
        
        ./makenek turbChannel

    7. run with wrapper nekmpi:
        
        ./nekmpi turbChannel [numberofprocs]
