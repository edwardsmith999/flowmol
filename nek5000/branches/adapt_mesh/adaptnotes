TO DO

change user input so that it works for the adaptive case 
   userbc currently works for scalars on an adaptive grid

handle AREA appropriately - let flux = 0 for now 
 
test the error calculator at higher orders - which metric is best?
Also, do we allow the order to drop for elements where very little
is happening?

successfully compile with -O2

look at dssum routines that contain apply_J and apply_Jt

make a new setvert routine for assembling glo_num
   - compute correctly the number of unique edge nodes in navier8.f, setvert2d.

make velocity/pressure adaptive

NOTES

The convective term uses the velocity grid geometric data rather than calling
ComputeG to get the temperature grid geometric data. (This refers to the routine
convect.f -> convect_new -> set_dealias_rx.) Do we need the higher order geometric
data of the scalar field since velocity is projected from the lower order grid
(unless the adaption increment is negative)?
