c These are Boussinesq-based stratified-flow examples that illustrate 
c the blocking phenomena in which fluid particles resist change in 
c elevation because of the potential energy change required to overcome 
c strong stratification.  The examples are based on a discussion found 
c in Tritton, "Physical Fluid Dynamics"  (Oxford University Press, 1988).
c Results for these cases can be found in the Nek5000 "users.pdf" examples
c file.
c 
c This is the Prandtl number Pr=1000 case.
c 
c In the simulations here, the hydrostatic pressure distribution is altered 
c so that we solve for a field that is uniform (i.e., not varying in the 
c y direction) at outflow, as this is the standard outflow condition in 
c Nek5000.  To illustrate the point, consider that the Boussinesq approximation 
c with a constant temperature field would give rise to a uniform body force in 
c the negative y-direction, and that the resulting hydrostatic pressure field 
c would vary linearly in y.   In the (linear) stratified flow case the forcing 
c is of the form
c 
c       ffy = temp / Fr2
c 
c where Fr2 is the Froude number squared and the temperature field has for 
c initial- and boundary-conditions a linear variation in y.   As it stands, 
c such a forcing would lead to a hydrostatice pressure field that varies 
c quadratically in y, and it is clear that p=0 at outflow would be incorrect.   
c To account for the vertical loading, we modify the forcing term to be
c 
c       ffy = (temp-y) / Fr2
c 
c which implies that the computed pressure differs from the actual pressure 
c by -.5*y*y/Fr2.  For the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and the 
c given boundary conditions this modification has no impact on the dynamics 
c of the flow.
