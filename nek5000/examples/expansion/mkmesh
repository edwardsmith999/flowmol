#
#  Example script to build 3D pipe expansion.
#
#  You will need the nek tools prenek/pretex and n2to3 built and
#  in your path  (usually, in $HOME/bin).
#
#

#  Procedure:
#  
#     .Start with cyl2d.rea file (taken from vortex 
#      directory w2dcyl010a.rea)
#  
#     .Use "ring.box" to build a ring with inner diamter 1 
#      that will surround cyl2d.
#  
#     .Make a larger cylinder by merging cyl2d with ring 
#      using "nekmerge2" script
#  
#     .Apply one round of quad refinement to cyl2d and large2d 
#      with "quad2" script
#  
#     .Extrude both cyl2dr and large2dr to 3D counter parts 
#      using n2to3
#  
#     .Merge cyl3dr and large3dr with nekmerge2 script
