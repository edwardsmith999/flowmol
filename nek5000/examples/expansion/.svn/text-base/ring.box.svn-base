2                      spatial dimension
1                      number of fields:   velocity + temperature
#========================================================================
#
#  This will make a circle with inner radius 1.0 and out radius 2.0
#
#  The circle is broken into two rings: 
#
#      Inner one has ascending element radii with scale factor 1.25
#
#      Outer one has descending element radii with scale factor 1/1.25
#
#  Each circle consists of 8 azimuthal segments in order to match with
#  base file 2dcyl.rea when the geometries are merged.
#
#  One has the option of refining both meshes at any point as long as
#  they are consistently refined prior to merging.
