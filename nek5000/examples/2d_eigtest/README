This example demonstrates spectral convergence of eigenvalues of 
the Laplacian for a problem that has deformed geometry (specifically,
for a quarter of a circular disk).

This case provides a reasonable test of the influence of 
geometric deformation on the accuracy of the SEM.

It should, however, be improved by accounting for both the 
azimuthal and radial modes using a full circle geometry instead 
of the quarter-circle given here.

To run this test, copy the current makenek from the repo 
source and then type:

   doall

The script will run through several polynomial orders and should 
produce two curves demonstrating spectral convergence for the 
lowest eigenvalue and for the max error over the first five radial
eigenvalues.    

The theory is outlined in eig1.usr, which is also given below.

c     For the analytic solution, the eigenvalues come in two forms, the
c     purely radial (m=0 mode), and the mth-wavenumber azimuthal mode.
c     This code computes approximations to all of these.
c
c     Here, we are interested in comparing to the radial mode only, but
c     we could compute analytic solutions for both types.   
c
c     For the unit disk (R:=1), the radial modes have eigenvalues that
c     are the square of the roots of J0, five of which are listed here:

c     The basic theoretical aspects of this test are listed below.
c
c     General solution to u_t = -A u is a series expansion in the
c     eigenfunctions of A:
c
c         u(X,t) = sum_k   exp ( - lam_k t ) phi_k (X) .
c
c     For Laplace in the unit disk with homogeneous Dirichlet conditions,
c
c         phi_k(X) = J_0 ( sqrt(lam_k) r ) .
c
c     Since phi_k(r=1) == 0, we have that
c
c         sqrt(lam_k) = x_k, the kth-zero of J_0(),  for k=1,2,... ,
c
c     so, 
c
c         lam_k(A) = (x_k)^2 .
c
c
c
c     In this example, we find lam_k() by solving a Poisson equation
c     with conjugate gradient (CG) iteration and then exploit the 
c     relationship between CG and Lanczos to get the eigenvalues of A.
c
c     If Ax=b is solved using preconditioned CG with preconditioner M,
c     the estimated spectrum approximates that of inv(M)*A.  In the
c     spectral element method, inv(B)*A approximates the Laplacian,
c     where B is the diagonal mass matrix and A the stiffness matrix.
c     Hence, CG will generate the desired eigenvalues if we set M=B.
c     To do so, one should uncomment 3 lines in setprec(), found in
c     hmholtz.f in the source directory.   We give a copy of the
c     modified source in hmholtz_b_prec.f.   The "doall" script
c     makes the requisite substitution in a local copy of the source.
