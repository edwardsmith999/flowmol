The example here closely follows the example outlined
in "primer.pdf".

There is a file "axi.box" that can be input to genbox,
which in turn will create box.rea.

Running genmap with "box" as input will then generate
box.map.

Running "mvv box axi"  will rename the box files to axi.*

There is already an axi.usr file that will provied a 
parabolic inflow on the interval y = [0:0.5].

makenek axi

will compile the code.

nekb axi  will run the case in background (for 200 steps).

Then posts or postx will allow viewing.
