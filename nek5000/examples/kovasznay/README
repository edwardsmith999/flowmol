 Kovasznay flow, an analytical two-dimensional steady solution  to the
 incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.

 stokes_test example uses the basics of the kovasznay problem to test
 user-explicit treatment of the nonlinear terms.

 s_convg demonstrates spectral convergence of the Kovasznay
 solution for the case of PN-PN
