c
c    This is a Blasius boundary layer test case in 2D.
c
c    It tests the "ON " boundary condition (Outflow, Normal only), given by:
c
c          u_parallel  - specified in userbc  (ux, uy, or uz)
c          d (u_n/ dn = 0
c
c    Note that the ON bc works only if the surface in question is normal
c    to either the X, Y, or Z axis.
c
c    In this test case the outflow condition is given by "O  ", which 
c    implies p + dU/dn = 0.
c
c    This configuration is set up for ymax=10, xmax ~= 480.   
c
c
c    At the end of the timestepping, most of the error is near the
c    outflow boundary, as would be expected.
c
c    The first field that is dumped is the exact solution, which is
c    also the initial condition.   Thus, you can check the error by
c    plotting the difference between the first time slice and any 
c    later slice.
