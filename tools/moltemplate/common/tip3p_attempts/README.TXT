This directory contains two LT files corresponding to 
different versions of TIP3P:

tip3pcharmm.lt # The implementation of TIP3P used by CHARMM (I think).
tip3p2004.lt   # The newer Price & Brooks, J. Chem Phys 2004 model 
               # which uses long-range coulombics

I have not tested these files so I moved them here.
(If you have tested these files, and they work, or if you have other comments 
or suggestions, feel free to email me at jewett.aij at gmail dot com.)
