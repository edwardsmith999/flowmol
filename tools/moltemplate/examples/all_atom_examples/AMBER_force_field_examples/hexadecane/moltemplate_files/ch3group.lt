# It contains definitions of the atoms "c3", "h1", as well as the force-field
# parameters for bonded and non-bonded interactions between them 
# (and many other atoms).

# The charges for the atoms in this example are all set to zero.
# In a realistic simulation, one must assign (partial) charges to each atom.
