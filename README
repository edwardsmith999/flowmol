Git repository management
=========================

The top-level repository contains a number of "forks" of external repositories.
The directories of these forks must be managed with the **subtree merge
strategy**, for which information may be found on [GitHub
help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-git-subtree-merges/) or in
`cpl-library/doc/git/subtree_instructions_github.html`.

The subtrees may be kept up-to-date with the following remotes: 

* lammps: https://github.com/lammps/lammps.git
* openfoam: https://github.com/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-2.3.x.git
* flowmol: git@bitbucket.org:crompulence/flowmol.git

Keeping the subtrees up-to-date
-------------------------------

The remotes above may be added by (this process need only be performed
once per clone), 

    git remote add lammps https://github.com/lammps/lammps.git
    git remote add openfoam https://github.com/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-2.3.x.git
    git remote add git@bitbucket.org:crompulence/flowmol.git

and each subtree may be updated from the upstream remote branch with:

    git pull -s subtree lammps master
    git pull -s subtree openfoam master
    git pull -s subtree flowmol master
