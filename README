Git repository management
-------------------------

The top-level repository contains a number of "forks" of external repositories.
The directories of these forks are to be managed with the **subtree merge
strategy**, for which information may be found on [GitHub
help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-git-subtree-merges/) or in
`cpl-library/doc/git/subtree_instructions_github.html`.

The subtrees may be kept up-to-date with the following remotes: 

    * lammps: https://github.com/lammps/lammps.git
    * open-foam: https://github.com/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-2.3.x.git
